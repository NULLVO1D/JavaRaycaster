# JavaRaycaster
A pure Java port of Lode's no-texture 3D ray caster he did in C. 

Done in IntelliJ Idea community version,
if you want to edit the code you can download a copy of the project files with git clone
or make a fork.

If you just want to try it out for fun,
there is an Oci.jar file in the bin folder.

WASD to move and that's all there is to it.
